#make buttons smaller as time goes on
#move buttons randomly around screen
#change colours on each click
#large centralised logo maybe it could flash
#increase speed at which buttons remain in a position before vanishing and causing loss of score/life
#scores or lives counter
#timers for buttons 
#buttons move to specific tempo?
